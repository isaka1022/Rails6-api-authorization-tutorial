# README

I made this rails application to study how to create authorization with token.

I referenced this 2 sites.

- [Build Restful APIs in a Rails 6 application with Token Authentication](https://medium.com/@billy.sf.cheng/a-rails-6-application-part-1-api-1ee5ccf7ed01)
- [Token-based Authentication with Ruby on Rails 5 API](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/token-based-authentication-with-ruby-on-rails-5-api)

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version
  - ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-darwin19]
  - Rails 6.0.2

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation
  postgreSQL

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
